;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Building CEDET is a challenge.  These utilities are needed to provide simple
;; functions for dealing with different environments for compilation of sources.

;;; Code:

(defun cedet-remove-builtin ()
  "Force any built-in CEDET to be removed from the load path.
Force all symbols that belong to CEDET to be unloaded.
This is a needed first step in getting CEDET installed from outside sources."
  (interactive)
  (when (featurep 'cedet)
    (error "Cannot unload builtin CEDET if CEDET is already loaded in."))
  (when (featurep 'eieio)
    (error "EIEIO is already loaded.  Removing CEDET now would be unwise."))
  (when (featurep 'semantic)
    (error "Semantic is already loaded.  Removing CEDET now would be unwise."))

  ;; Remove from load-path.
  (let* ((clp (locate-library "cedet"))
	 (root (when clp (directory-file-name (file-name-directory clp))))
	 )
    (setq load-path (delete root load-path)))

  ;; Find ALL autoloaded symbols related to CEDET, and delete them.
  (dolist (R '("^cedet" "^semantic" "^global-ede-" "^srecode-")) 
    (dolist (S (apropos R))
      (when (and (fboundp (car S))
		 (let ((sf (symbol-function (car S))))
		   (and (listp sf) (eq (car sf) 'autoload))))
	(fmakunbound (car S)))))
  )
(cedet-remove-builtin)
(provide 'cedet-butil)
