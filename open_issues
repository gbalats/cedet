* All explicit requires in the Makefile will lead to execution errors when
  running a non-compiled CEDET (thus should probably modify code into the proper
  requires)
* The 'obsolete' directory contains files that were no longer referenced from
  the original Project.ede files
* Should compatibility functions be maintained (cedet-compat)?
** cedet-called-interactively-p
** cedet-split-string
* Speedbar documentation has been stripped out of many details
** speedbar-stealthy-function-list
** speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list
** Detailed description on how to create new contents (speedbar.el now contains
   a brief summary)
* speedbar-sort-tags is described as obsolete, but widely used
* speedbar-require-version : commented out
* speedbar-sort-tags : obsolete
* inversion-upgrade-package : commented out
* lisp/cedet/mode-local : removed and commented out lots of code
* seggregated unit tests from lisp/cedet/cedet-files.el into tests/cedet-files-utests.el
* seggregated unit tests from lisp/cedet/inversion.el into tests/inversion.el
* seggregated unit tests from lisp/cedet/pulse.el into tests/pulse.el
* removed integration advices in lisp/cedet/pulse.el
* removed edebug-setup-hook entry in lisp/cedet/ede/base.el
* cedet/ede unit tests are not loaded into the test infrastructure
* ede documentation has been stripped out of many sections, but others were
  added; someone should check if any useful information has fallen out:
  substitute all old "@include" in ede.texi for the contents of the included
  file, then diff with the new version
* move cedet/ede/proj-skel.el into etc/ or similar
* synchronize documentation for semantic (doc/semantic/)
* emacs: cedet/semantic/bovine/scm-by.el <=> cedet: cedet/semantic/bovine/scheme-by.el
* emacs: cedet/semantic/wisent/javat-wy.el <=> cedet: cedet/semantic/wisent/java-tags-wy.el
* emacs: cedet/semantic/wisent/js-wy.el => cedet: cedet/semantic/wisent/javascript-jv-wy.el
* remove (or at least move out of lisp/) cedet build files:
** lisp/cedet/semantic/ede-grammar.el
** lisp/cedet/semantic/grammar.el
* lisp/cedet/semantic/fw.el: deleted lots of compatibility code
* lisp/cedet/semantic/senator.el: have a close look
* lisp/cedet/semantic/grammar*: fix generation of meta-grammar
* lisp/cedet/srecode/fields.el: Deleted overlay compatibility code for xemacs
